# leaflet-challenge

The purpose of this assignment is to create a tool that will allow USGS which allows them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.

There were two steps/levels to this assignment and I only completed the first part due to lack of time. 

The data is being collected from the USGS url where they provide GeoJSON data. I went with the data set to look at earthquake data in the last 7 days. 

For the visualization, I created a map using Leaflet that plotted all earthquakes by their size and the color represents the depth of the earthquake. There are two map layers to choose from: Street Map and Dark Map. Tooltips have been included to give additional information about the earthquake and the legend defines the color scheme which again,represents the depth of the quake.
